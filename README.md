# Expensify

The core of this app was developed from [Andrew Meade's amazing React course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/overview). You can see the base app [here](http://expensify.mead.io/).

### My version is accessible [here](https://hinrichs-expensify.herokuapp.com/).

Once you log into my app, you can go to the [Additions page](https://hinrichs-expensify.herokuapp.com/additions) (accessible by clicking "About" at the bottom of the site) where I've cataloged all the modificatiosn and updates I've made to the project. Add some expenses in and check out all the features.
