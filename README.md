# zScroller

[Demo](https://zscroller.herokuapp.com/) (it's using a free Heroku dyno, which goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, so be patient on first load)

I'm wrapping this up for now so I can spend time on more important things. You can check the TODO list if you want to see the potential places this could go.

Basically, you mouseover a frame and it gives you a title on a transparency. Clicking brings you to fullscreen. Scrolling down brings you back out to the main level. I programmed the scroll snap (between frames) by myself, and it's kind of jankey, especially on screens with lots of pixels. Maybe I'll come back to it someday and build out all the features I wanted.
