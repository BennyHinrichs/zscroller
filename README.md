# zScroller

This is my project to make a template for a "new" style of webpage. The goal is to have each content page in a container the size of the viewport, the content pages themselves being perhaps 75% the size. Scrolling eases you to the next container. Clicking on a page zooms it to the size of the viewport. Scrolling down takes you back to the top level (ergo each page is designed to only be the size of the viewport). Inside a page can be tiles of other nested pages. Clicking on them zooms your selection to the size of the viewport. If you're more than one level deep, there will be a "to top" option, and clicking it will zoom back to the main level.

The thought behind the "scroll to move levels" design is that it obviates the need for a button to handle the action, which delivers a more pleasant user experience. The other idea is clicking the scroll wheel to zoom out and pinching on mobile.

This design lends itself very well to a portfolio-style site, or any site where you're trying to display various content. Say you're a digital artist. Each top-level page can be a different project you worked on. Clicking on one will take you to a screen with all the images from that project.
